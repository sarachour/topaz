# Outlier Detector
1. Better understand bodytrack, barnes ill behaviour [DONE]
	- run barnes with 16K
	- look at bodytrack weights properly.
2. Add modifications to control system - target re-exec rate. [DONE]

1. Add 10 random seed trials to script
   - refactor scripts to do these random seeds.
   - heavy workload on everything.
   
2. Add more hardware models. 
   - reduced precision fpu experiments.
   - other hardware models

3. Task size?
   - too small? high overhead.
   - too large? high error probability.
   - solution 1: scheduling between high priority and low priority machines [no; large engineering effort]
   - solution 2: sanity checks (restarts task)
